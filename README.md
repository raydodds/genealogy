RIT's Engineering House has a mentorship program where every year
the on-floor second years take a mentee from the incoming second years.
The mentee-mentor pair is usually chosen from people who are socially
compatible where the mentor can help their mentee get adjusted to 
life in college. This program has been around for about a decade or
so at this point.

This program takes a .tsv file with the name of the mentees, their
mentor's name, and any positions that they held on floor and renders
a graph of the connections, highlighting members of cabinet in yellow
and members of the executive board in blue. Non-position holding members
are the default black. Adoptions, which have become more popular in recent
years, are noted by dashed lines. Solid lines are the assigned
relationships.

Please note that due to the nature of college as a constantly cycling
environment where only about five years of people co-exist at once,
some of the older relations have been lost or are based on older,
incomplete and hard to interpret files. The current record is maintained
by hand as a google sheet and exported to .tsv when updates need to
be made, so all information represented here may not be 100% accurate.
